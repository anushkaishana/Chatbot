    "EduBuddy is a chatbot designed for students that provides learning and person support. EduBuddy helps students with various areas such as motivation, study tips, basic queries, dictionary lookups, a bit of math problem solving and even providing resources.\n",
    "The core domain of EduBuddy is an education and personal assistant which offers an invaluable resource for students navigating academic challenges.\n",
    "The chatbot operates by understanding and processing user input, matching it to predefined intents and generating dynamic, context-sensitive responses. Thus, it caters to a range of use cases right from providing answers to definitions, math problems and even offering emotional support and personalized engagement. It is well suited for educational learning platforms, academic counselling and such making it a very versatile solution in the educational technology space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use-case scenarios:\n",
    "1.\tEducational assistance: EduBuddy assists with basic inquiries across different subjects. The chatbot can explain certain ideas, provide definitions, or direct the user to trusted resources. This follows the aim to bridge knowledge gaps and offer accessible learning support.\n",
    "2.\tEmotional support and motivation: In this day and age, recognizing mental and emotional challenges faced by students is key. EduBuddy goes beyond the academics to offer encouragement and motivation. When a user/student feels overwhelmed, the chatbot can provide gentle reminders of progress and motivational quotes instilling a sense of interaction and positivity. This feature is aimed at maintaining and boosting student morale and keeping them focused in achieving whatever their goals may be.\n",
    "3.\tAdvanced query handling: EduBuddy leverages external APIs like Wolfram Alpha for mathematical problems and Merriam-Webster for word definitions in addition to the existing intents Json. This allows EduBuddy to be capable of addressing a range of question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test-cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tScenario: A user introduces themselves and asks for study tips.\n",
    "User: “Can you give me some study tips?\"\n",
    "Expected Behaviour: EduBuddy should provide study tips in a personalized manner.\n",
    "Response:\n",
    "EduBuddy: \" A great way to start is by organizing your study schedule and taking short breaks in between sessions. Is there a particular subject you're struggling with?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tScenario: A user misspells words in their query, and EduBuddy corrects these mistakes before processing.\n",
    "User: \"Defnition of accerleration.\"\n",
    "Expected Behavior:\n",
    "EduBuddy uses TextBlob to identify and correct spelling errors (\"defnition\" to \"definition\" and \"accerleration\" to \"acceleration\"). It then proceeds to query the Merriam-Webster API for the corrected word.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tScenario: The user asks a math question that requires derivative calculation.\n",
    "User: \"What is 5+5?\"\n",
    "Expected Behaviour: EduBuddy identifies the math query and forwards it to the Wolfram Alpha API for processing. If the query is successful, it retrieves the solution from Wolfram Alpha.\n",
    "Response (Successful Query): EduBuddy: \"10\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Alternative Input (Invalid Query):\n",
    "    User: \"What is 5 + wrong ?\"\n",
    "    Expected Behavior: EduBuddy detects that the query involves invalid input\n",
    "    Response (Failed Query):\n",
    "    Attempt 1: \"Sorry, I couldn't process that math expression. Could you try rephrasing?\"\n",
    "    Attempt 2: \" Sorry, I couldn't process that math expression. Could you try rephrasing?\"\n",
    "    Attempt 3: \" Sorry, I don't think I can help you with that. You might want to try using a calculator or a math solver tool.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Connection to Lecture material:\n",
    "The project is heavily drawn on concepts from natural language processing and other such techniques that were core topics during lectures.\n",
    "Firstly, using nltk and nlp: For my chatbot, after further research, I have utilized spaCy for preprocessing user input which includes tokenization, lemmatization and stopword removal. This reduces need of doing each separated and helps ensure that user queries are correctly interpreted. It focuses on what word is the most important and filters the unwanted details.\n",
    "Intent matching and regex patterns were something we worked on a lot during class. EduBuddy relies on intent matching to identify users query and reply accordingly, and this is achieved using combining pattern-based recognition with a semantic understanding. Regular expressions have also been implemented to extract details from user input and is specifically being used for name extraction in addition to other details.\n",
    "Another component that I have advanced with based on the class material is API integration. I have integrated 2 APIs thereby leveraging real-world resources to enhance the chatbots capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced techniques and features:\n",
    "EduBuddy has been equipped with several advanced features, setting it apart from other basic chatbots thereby making it more interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tSpelling correction: Coming from both experience and observations, typos are very common and user inputs are likely to get unrecognised because of this. Hence, I have imported and processed user input against TextBlob which automatically corrects errors in the spelling. This ensures that even if user makes typographical mistakes, chatbot can still understand and respond appropriately.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2.\tDynamic username handling: User’s name is extracted via regex patterns and nlp methods after which chatbot stores this and uses it dynamically in future responses, creating a better sense of interaction that is personalized. Another feature using the same name is instead of having it as a “user:”, the user’s name replaces the label.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "3.\tFailed attempt handing: If a math problem cannot be processed after several tries, the message presented will be different directing user to use a calculator or search elsewhere. This is provided based of a counter that tracks failed query attempts. This ensures that the chatbot provides user-centric responses and engages with users even in the face of challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tMulti-layered intent matching: Intent matching, integrating API calls and even fallback mechanisms are applied to cover a wide range of queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.\tResource recommendations: Understanding the limitations of answering capabilities, based on subject related queries, EduBuddy dynamically recommends educational resources. This helps guide users to valuable tools that could enhance their learing experience.\n",

The overall phases involved were planning, developing, testing and refinement in the end. For each of these I set time-bound goals to ensure I completed everything at the right time. Despite occasional setbacks due to lack of resources or research, consistent progress tracking helped maintain the overall project timeline. Even though lectures for chatbot lasted over 5 -7 weeks, I decided to make it a point to completely imbibe all the information and only begin once I was fully confident. When uploading the code from my personal folder onto the assessment template I came across a certain error with loading the chatbot and this helped highlight the importance of scheduling buffer time for such unexpected complications. Overall following all phases and regularly checking with phase deadlines ensured that the over result ended up not compromised at all.\n",

The tasks I had split the project into as mentioned earlier are – text preprocessing, intent matching, response handling, API integration for advancements and so.

    "Furthermore, to maintain consistency, comprehensive commenting and such naming conventions were used. Once the base chatbot was created, and I had a structured design, I extended on it by researching on various advancement features that could implemented such as dynamic name handling, spelling correction and so. By staying methodical and prioritizing clarity, I could efficiently refine the application while meeting user expectations and maintaining the integrity of the codebase.\n",

    "The development of EduBuddy spanned across around 6 weeks, with first four weeks dedicated to learning and preparation and final weeks were spent on active implementation and refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through weeks 1-3, my primary focus was to get my foundation right and understand the basic concepts of chatbot development. Completing lab tasks and getting formative feedback on the same really added a boost to the whole process as I there were a few valuable insights. Some of the main were regarding regular expressions and how I could further refine it and using lemmatization. Feedback in these stages helped highlight the need for better handling of user input and getting responses. Personal user testing and brainstorming at this stage also encouraged me to clarify the target audience and use case leading me to choose the educational domain.\n",
    "I also researched about external APIs and grasp tools like spaCy, NLTK and textBlob. While no coding was done, I started working on setting phases, deadlines for the same and helped me gain confidence to approach the implementation systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2 weeks I spent on my implementation began by creating the chatbot’s basic structure. In the first week, I implemented core functionalities like text preprocessing, intent matching, and simple response generation. To address better handling, I integrated spaCy and added regex and even designed fallback responses for unhandled queries. After this is when API integration and integrating textBlob for spelling corrections came into play when I started thinking about how users would feel like the interaction is more conversational. This stage is when API query related error came about leading to alternative suggestions based on research.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last few days, I focused on testing rigorously and polishing EduBuddy to the best of my abilities. This phase also included commenting the code to ensure clarity and maintainability.\n",
    "Overall, by strategically planning and dividing time, I was able to create a user-friendly, functional chatbot to my satisfaction.\n",
